            My first time out of the country to see the world...
          </div>
          <div class="body">
            ...was a trip to Rome to view the work of Michelangelo.  I literally spend a week visiting the Pieta.  Mesmerized.  May 21, 1972 a mentally disturbed geologist, walked into the chapel and attacked the sculpture with a hammer, breaking off several pieces.  I cried as the tour guide recounted that story. People clamored for the fragments, understandably.  They got most of the pieces back, aside from the nose.<br /><br />Would you have returned that nose if you had it?
